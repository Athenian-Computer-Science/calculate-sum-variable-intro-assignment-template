# Calculate Sum

## Problem Description
Write a program that does the following:
* Prompts the user for three numbers
* Calculates the sum of those numbers
* Prints the result in a nicely formatted sentence.

**Extensions**
* Include the numbers being added in the printed response, in addition to the sum.
* **Challenge** Can you do this in only 4 lines?

## Example (sample inputs in parentheses)
```
Enter a number: (7)
Enter a second number: (12)
Enter a third number: 2
output: 21
output with extension: The sum of 7, 12 and 2 is 21.
output with extension, version 2: 7 + 12 + 2 = 21

```

## Notes
* Test your code at least three times with different inputs to be sure it works as expected.
* Commit and Push to GitHub
* There is no test code, but be sure your changes appear on GitHub
